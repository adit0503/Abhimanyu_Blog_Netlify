            A few days ago, I read an interview in which singer Bebe Rexha said that designers refuse to dress her for the Grammy’s because she's a Size 8. A statement and news piece which left me appalled, yet again. That thousands of designers and fashion houses are still so shallow leaves me at a loss of words. Not that I ever felt very strongly towards these couture brands or the industry, but I was never for one to believe that people, in general, can be so parochial towards one another. But if you think that the problem of body shaming a person is only something we hear of in certain industries, it is time to take a step back and look around again.
          </p>

            Up close, you’ll notice that more than half the people around us are affected by how they look and what people perceive them to be. Secretly tucking in tummies, wearing clothes that hide their body shape; the pain we put people through with, but a jibe or distasteful glance makes me question the very principle of “being human”. It’s amusing how certain designers are lauded for using plus sized models or certain filmmakers are praised for giving pivotal roles to a “chubby” actor, when these things should be considered normal in the first place. I also fail to understand the need for separate plus sized stores; it’s like branding a person with a label and designating them a place different from the rest of the “normal sized” crowd.
          </p>

          <p>
            It’s dis-heartening to see how few a people understand the psyche of an individual that is called fat or overweight. It seems to be so easy and convenient for everybody to hand down a piece of advice for the “fat one”, without realizing how patronizing and belittling it would sound to them, as if they aren’t already aware of what they look like. More often than not, the infamous art of nagging and snubbing begins in the vicinity of our homes and schools and we are attacked by it at a very impressionable age. Till you’re 7-8 years old, chubby is considered cute but the word loses its meaning as you grow older because nobody likes chubby teenagers or adults.

            “Don’t wear that it makes your butt look too big and your tummy shows”
          </p>

          <p>
            “No you can’t get that dress your legs are too fat for it. Such stuff looks good on thin girls” – Most of us have heard this haven’t we?
          </p>

          <p>
            Just one statement like that can have life-changing ramifications on the self-esteem of a person, young or old. Let’s make one thing very clear – nobody revels in being fat or overweight; on the contrary you’ll see that most of the people end up stress or binge eating out of body consciousness, low self-esteem and helplessness, spiraling downwards into a vicious cycle or self-harm through unruly habits.
          </p>

          <p>
            Yes, it is important to take care of yourself, maintain a good balanced lifestyle, exercise, eat well and what not. But as you read this, we all need to understand that there is a thin line between encouraging someone to be more disciplined or take up a healthy lifestyle and crushing their self-respect by passing a remark or throwing a jibe. So to all of you ashamed to look at your reflection in the mirror, I can only say this – you can live your best life even as a size 16 or 20. You’re smart and capable; you have a heart in your chest and a head on your shoulders. Your size will not determine the trajectory of your life, but only your actions and intent will.
          </p>

          <p>
            To those casting sneering, judgmental glances at people like us; peers, parents, bystanders’ and the like – take a good long look in the mirror and ask of yourself – will we ever be anything greater than our bodies?
