            Why is it that the ones closest to us, often end up hurting us the most? How is it that we find ourselves in the same position every time and the result for us is no different? Trust me, I’m probably just as baffled as you are at this toxic cycle that we cannot seem to get ourselves out of.
          </p>

          <p>
            Everyone I speak to seems to have only two options of dealing with emotional damage; you either clamp up and ice everyone out to be safe, or you open your heart to the danger of being pierced through, one too many times. As much as a part of me always leans towards having an un-apologetically open heart, it is not lost on me that there could possibly be a middle path in making ourselves “selectively vulnerable”.
          </p>

          <p>
            I remember this one biology lesson from the class of 2008, where we were being taught about the structure of a cell and a particular part of it, called the mitochondria (it’s the powerhouse of a cell but don’t ask me what that means I was too busy reading Charles Dickens). Our teacher went on to explain to a presumably sleepy bunch of students the function of a mitochondria. Now I know you’re all wondering where this is headed and how this could possibly be connected to the topic in question; well, bear with me for a minute.
          </p>

          <p>
            One function of the mitochondria (love writing this word it makes me sound so intelligent), is to be “selectively permeable”, which means that it only allows in what is needed and throws out the rest. It has two layers (membranes), one which allows everything in, no holds barred and the second inner layer which cannot be surpassed, unless need be.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now I know this may sound weird to most of you, but try putting this very property of a tiny component of a cell, to your whole life. It appears to be of mammoth importance for us to build around ourselves, these “membranes” or protective covers as I will to call it. Adding layers to our person, so that we choose what pierces right through and gets us in the gut, or what enters our layers just enough to realize how it may damage us and throw it out.
          </p>

          <p>
            More often than not, we will always find ourselves in situations or circumstances where the wounds inflicted will be verbal and always at a time we’re not ready. Truth be spoken, we never quite are. But we should be prepared to brace the impact and deal with the aftermath of damage that people are more than capable of causing to one another. I don’t know about you but I’m not ready to be so vulnerable that people closest to me find ways of trampling over my being and rendering me incapable of recovering from words that can’t be taken back. But I’m also not one for bringing up impenetrable walls and not letting people in through the course of my life.
          </p>

          <p>
            Funny how the smallest unit of existence found it absolutely necessary to teach us a thing or two about survival. I guess I’ll find myself contemplating and acting upon this life lesson for times to come, and I’m guessing I won’t be doing it alone. After all, how many blows can we take before falling on our knees, lost and worn out, incapable of mustering courage to get back up?
          </p>

          <p>
            To anyone reading this - It’s all in your hands now. Build up your layers and choose how much you let in. After all, at the beginning of every journey you make, every decision you take; there’s always a choice.
