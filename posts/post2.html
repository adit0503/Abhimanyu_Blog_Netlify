          <p>
          It happens.
          </p>

          <p>
          One moment you’re hesitant to ride your first bike, afraid you might fall. But then come the firm protective hands and the soft yet deeply hoarse voice saying “You can do it, child.”
          </p>

          <p>
          And then it’s all gone. Those hands begin to wrinkle and feet begin to wobble; the knees buckled with age one day, eyes looking around with hope and ears listened in earnest, but no voice said “You can still do it, father”.
          </p>

          <p>
          It happens.
          </p>

          <p>
          One moment you’re laughing and surrounded by people; catching up on bygone times, promising to keep the memory ball rolling.
          </p>

          <p>
          And then it’s all gone. The group vanishes, the voices fade to black and all that remains is a daunting white of absolute calm; a silence that haunts.
          </p>

          <p>
          It Happens
          </p>

          <p>
          One moment you’re squeezing your lover’s hand, whispering rasp promises of an imagined forever; knowing private smiles and eyes filled with love.
          </p>

          <p>
          And then it’s all gone. The hands untangle, the eyes look away; knowing smiles of love now turn to knowing smiles of broken promises and lost emotions.
          </p>

          <p>
          It happens.
          </p>

          <p>
          And when it does, it’s like the land shivers below your feet. It cracks up slowly and creates divide; a divide between your heart and your mind. Voices scream everywhere and numb out the world.
          </p>

          <p>
          You struggle in the dark, looking for answers, helpless, hopeless, falling apart; piece by piece. They ask what’s wrong but words stop at the cusp of your lips, filled with self-doubt.
          </p>

          <p>
          It happens.
          </p>

          <p>
          And then, it begins to fade away; slowly, like a melancholy against the back drop of the battles you’ve fought. You drop your weapons and fall to your knees, overwhelmed and vulnerable.
          </p>

          <p>
          And then you begin to find your way back to shed it all off; like a serpent wriggling out of its old skin. You head out to the light that pours into from the crevices of your wounds and let it fall on the new you.
          </p>

          <p>
          It happens.
          </p>
