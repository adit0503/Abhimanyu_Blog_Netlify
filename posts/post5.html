        <p>
          Consciousness, is a term rather vague. There is no objectionable definition to it. It is everything and nothing. Its where we are right now, and where we weren't and would be. It's omnipresent. You neither can define it's existence nor can conclude it. It's operational at a vibration unknown. Every answer is another question, and every question is the answer.
        </p>

        <p>
          Imagine a cardboard box. Kept on a smooth surface, a table, a couple of feet above the ground. Now take a pebble. If I ask you to place that pebble in the box, you'd place it at any random location in the box, where it'd stay at the specific position it's placed, for maybe the rest of eternity, under favourable circumstances.
        </p>

        <p>
          But now if I'd ask you to shut the lid of the box and pick it up and stand, during the entire transition of the cardboard box's placement on the table to in your hand until you're upright, the pebble could have moved about anywhere in the entire empty space of the box. Now if that box and you hold still for eternity, the pebble will too now, be in the new position it's acquired, for eternity.
        </p>

        <p>
          But to err is human.
        </p>

        <p>
          We try to adjust our position, get in a more comfortable zone where we can withstand the same stance, until the inevitable threshold. And all throughout these movements, the pebble could have moved anywhere now.
        </p>

        <p>
          That's where we stand with our consciousness. We have begun on this journey, beginning at some point. There is no specific reason for it to be there, but it is. The entire journey of a box with unknown location of where the pebble is in the box.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some trail the path, to find answers about where the pebble could be, unaware of the fact that the answer is different everytime.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now imagine, I tell you to throw the box you're holding in your hands, down a rocky slope, a 100 feet drop.
          The box would have had it's first impact followed by a series of consequential probabilities.
        </p>

        <p>
          And during the entire run of events, the pebble would be nowhere and everywhere in the box. It could be anywhere. As it always has been an empty cardboard box with a pebble in it. That pebble could have been anywhere in that box, but it was where we chose to keep it. Although it had a possibility of being in the exact same spot until the end of time, the unforseen events altered the possibility, to a completely new one.
        </p>

        <p>
          Until, there comes a point, when it could be somewhere, where it couldn't have been the entire duration from closing the lid to when the box has an impact which forces the lid open, and now, the pebble could be anywhere in this entire universe. It can be nowhere and everywhere, at once.
        </p>

        <p>
          And that's how we humans have evolved, in a much introspective way. We have realised this fact that the pebble can be anywhere. But what we failed to perceive from this detailed analogy was that the pebble wasn't the resemblance to consciousness.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was the empty space. Our consciousness is the empty space in the box, and not the pebble. The pebble was a mere perception of our own consciousness. It never was the pebble, it was everywhere. It's never until the lid opens that you could know where the pebble could be. As all along, the pebble was the frequency which we perceived was the probable definition of consciousness.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was an entity conceived by our own consciousness, although it always knew, that it is conceiving itself.
        </p>

        <p>
          Confinement. Which our consciousness stands amidst. A self constructed confinement. Stuck in an infinite loop, of breaking down the construct and building a new one altogether.
        </p>

        <p>
          Incited, but untapped.
          <br>
