          <p>
          As a child, most of my decisions felt easy, like they were guided by the breeze; priorities were crystal clear like free-flowing water and the world didn’t seem such a blur to the then small eyes. Yet I somehow felt that becoming older would mean that I would have more power, greater resources and definitely better sense to determine what’s right.
          </p>

          <p>
          Turns out, the joke is on me after all. Most of you reading this would have gone through several phases of life so I ask of you; how do you know it’s right? The timing, the person, the place, the job; what tells you that this is it?
          </p>

          <p>
          Over the years, we find ourselves so disappointed in people and feel so exploited in certain situations that I end up questioning everything I believed in, as a child. Now, in my mid-twenties, at the age where I should be “settled” and have it all, I still ask myself in the middle of the night – “What is it that I really want?”
          </p>

          <p>
          How do I know that the next day at work wouldn’t be so bad? What part of me will know that the next person won’t break my heart? How will I spot the real deal in all the farce that I find myself surrounded with?
          </p>

          <p>
          The deafening silence that follows is scary, isn’t it? Some nights it feels worse than being engulfed in a chaos of thoughts. Some of us are afraid to turn off the lights at night, wanting to escape facing our darkest fear - Silence.
          </p>

          <p>
          But on some nights, in that absolute moment of stillness, I faintly hear a tiny voice deep inside me, almost drowned out by the disarray in my head and around me. Every night before I collapse on my bed, burdened with exhaustion and an impalpable sense of defeat, I silence everything around me to take a minute; go within and find that little voice.
          </p>

          <p>
          So you. Turn off those lights. Tune out the world. Tip-toe into bed, be still and go under. Look for that voice. When you do find it, listen to what it tells you. Follow it, because that call from within will stem from the deepest recesses of your soul, one you lived out as a child and it will guide you to what you want. You will find yourself traversing varied paths until you find THAT person, THAT place, THAT moment when you’ll be still and hear the faint but abominably brave whisper, “This is it; this feels right.”
